# personal-portfolio
Personal portfolio site to showcase projects and work.

Built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and using the Bootstrap framework (4.1.3).

Two snippets were used from [Bootsnipp](https://bootsnipp.com/):
* [an animated menu](https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/qrGeD) which was changed significantly to suit the site. Fontawesome fonts were used for the icons.
* [animated social media icons](https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/social-icon-strip-footer) which were tailored with different colours, links and Fontawesome fonts as icons.

The nav bar and footer were built using examples from the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/).

Extra skills learnt/practiced: Bootstrap, SVG, Google Analytics/SEO.

Full lighthouse audits were conducted and the site updated to ensure accessibility, responsiveness, good SEO rankings and load times.
