# personal-portfolio
Personal portfolio site to showcase projects and work.

Built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and using the Bootstrap framework (4.1.3).

Two snippets were used from [Bootsnipp](https://bootsnipp.com/):
* [an animated menu](https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/qrGeD) which was tailored with Fontawesome fonts for the icons.
* [animated cards](https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/team-design-card-flipper-using-bootstrap-4) which were tailored with project images and Github links.

These were heavily tweaked and refined to suit the website.

The nav bar and footer were built using examples from the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/).

Extra skills learnt/practiced: Bootstrap, SVG, Google Analytics/SEO.
